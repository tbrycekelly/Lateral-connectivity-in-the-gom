### About the Project

Spurred on by data collected on two field expeditions into the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico (GoM), we tested hypotheses about the source of bioavailable nitrogen to the GoM. Possible sources included local upwelling, N2-fixation, and/or lateral advection from more nutrient-rich waters.



All scripts and data necessary to run this model are provided as part of this REPO.

#### Running the model
1. First, a recent version of R is required. We recommend RStudio as a convenient front-end and IDE.
2. Download the files in this REPO: Green code button > Download Zip.
3. Included is this readme, and two directories:
 * R: The R folder contains all r scripts to run and analyze model output.
 * RX: Batch processing scripts used to preprocess raw datasetes.
 * Kelly et al. Manuscript: Folder contains a preprint and figures of the model as well as the final dataset (.rdata format) and sensitivity tests.

### Abstract & Citation

__ABSTRACT__
In contrast to its productive coastal margins, the open-ocean Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is notable for highly stratified surface waters with extremely low nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations. Field campaigns in 2017 and 2018 identified low rates of turbulent mixing, which combined with oligotrophic nutrient conditions, give very low estimates for diffusive flux of nitrate into the euphotic zone (< 1 µmol N m-2 d-1). Estimates of local N2-fixation are similarly low. In comparison, measured export rates of sinking particulate organic nitrogen (PON) from the euphotic zone are 2 – 3 orders of magnitude higher (i.e. 462 – 1144 µmol N m-2 d-1). We reconcile these disparate findings with regional scale dynamics inferred independently from remote-sensing products and a regional biogeochemical model and find that laterally-sourced organic matter is sufficient to support >90% of open-ocean nitrogen export in the GoM. Results show that lateral transport needs to be closely considered in studies of biogeochemical balances, particularly for basins enclosed by productive coasts.
